    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>White Castle sliders are well known in the Chicago area. I believe down South they are called Krystals. </p>
    <p>Serve each slider with American cheese, dill pickle slices, and Düsseldorf mustard.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>24 small square dinner rolls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine ground chuck, bread crumbs, egg, onion soup mix, water, and black pepper in a bowl; press into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Prick holes through the chuck mixture for ventilation while cooking.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Cut chuck mixture into squares the size of the rolls. Place 1 chuck patty in each roll.</li>
    </ol>
